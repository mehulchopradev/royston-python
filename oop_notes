Object oriented programming
- Correspondence between Real world <-> Software world

1. Real world actor -> Data in RAM
    - Objects
        - str, int, float, bool
        - Student, Book, Account
    - Class
        - We create objects from a class
        - A class also gives a data type to an object
        - 1 to n objects from a class
2. Real world actor characteristics -> Attributes of the object
    - Create an attribute in the object
        s1.attribute-name = value
3. Real world actor actions -> Method calls on the object
    - s1.method_call()


- Book
- every book in library <-> Book object
- class : Book
- characteristics:
    - title
    - price
    - pages
- Book('Book 1', 900, 560) -> Book.__init__(address, 'Book 1', 900, 560)
- bobj.get_details()
- bobj.is_expensive()
    - A book is expensive when its price is more than 600


- Immutability
    - After the creation of an object with its attributes, we cannot modify any
    of the attributes of that object
