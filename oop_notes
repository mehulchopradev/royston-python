Object oriented programming
- Correspondence between Real world <-> Software world

1. Real world actor -> Data in RAM
    - Objects
        - str, int, float, bool
        - Student, Book, Account
    - Class
        - We create objects from a class
        - A class also gives a data type to an object
        - 1 to n objects from a class
2. Real world actor characteristics -> Attributes of the object
    - Create an attribute in the object
        s1.attribute-name = value
3. Real world actor actions -> Method calls on the object
    - s1.method_call()
